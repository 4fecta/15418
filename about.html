<p>We are two 15-210 TAs interested in bringing algorithms from our course into real life! This website contains all of the documentation for our 15-418 final project journey.</p>

<p>Since the dawn of time, we've been claiming in 15-210 that Borůvka's algorithm has \(O(m \log n)\) work and \(O(\log^2 n)\) span. While the work bound might be believable, what is up with that miniscule span bound?? Although we've tried convincing you using long-winded mathematical analysis of the algorithm and the expected runtime of star contraction, we've never actually produced physical evidence that such an algorithm could be realized on a real computer that doesn't have "infinitely many" processors...</p>

<p>Until now.</p>

<p>Please witness as we demonstrate, in full detail, the true power of parallel Borůvka's algorithm.</p>
